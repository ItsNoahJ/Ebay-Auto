# Project Goals

## Primary Objective
Develop a robust VHS tape cover image processing system that can accurately extract:
- Title text
- Year information
- Runtime details

## Technical Requirements

1. **Image Processing Pipeline**
   - Handle various lighting conditions
   - Process skewed or slightly rotated images
   - Deal with different VHS cover formats and layouts
   - Extract text from complex backgrounds
   - Support multiple text colors and contrasts

2. **OCR Optimization**
   - Improve text extraction accuracy
   - Handle multiple font styles and sizes
   - Support varying text orientations
   - Recognize overlapping or closely spaced text

3. **Text Region Detection**
   - Accurately identify key information regions
   - Handle varying layouts and formats
   - Support different aspect ratios and resolutions
   - Process both standard and non-standard cover layouts

## Current Challenges

1. **Text Recognition Issues**
   - Low confidence scores on text extraction
   - Poor handling of text with complex backgrounds
   - Issues with closely spaced characters
   - Difficulty with varying font styles

2. **Image Processing Limitations**
   - Preprocessing pipeline needs improvement
   - Color-based segmentation not optimal
   - Edge detection missing some text regions
   - Deskewing needs refinement

3. **Region Detection Problems**
   - ROI positioning needs adjustment
   - Text region boundaries not optimal
   - Overlapping text regions causing issues
   - Background interference in detection

## Next Steps

1. **Preprocessing Improvements**
   - Implement HSV color space segmentation
   - Add multi-scale text detection
   - Enhance character-level processing
   - Improve edge detection accuracy

2. **OCR Enhancements**
   - Test different Tesseract PSM modes
   - Implement character-level confidence scoring
   - Add post-processing text cleanup
   - Validate results with multiple passes

3. **Testing and Validation**
   - Create comprehensive test suite
   - Add more test images with variations
   - Implement result validation logic
   - Track accuracy improvements
