# VHS Auto-Scanning Project Status

## Current Status

The project is a VHS scanning system that uses computer vision and OCR to extract information from VHS covers.

### Recent Improvements (Feb 20, 2025)
- Enhanced OCR reliability using LM Studio vision model
- Fixed issues with hallucinated text/numbers
- Added strict VHS-cover-only detection
- Added debug logging for image processing
- Set up .gitignore to keep repository clean

### Core Components
- Vision System (src/vision/):
  - Uses LM Studio for OCR
  - Handles title, year, and runtime extraction
  - Includes debug image output
  - Conservative detection to prevent false positives

- Configuration:
  - Environment variables (.env)
  - Media features (config/media_features.json)
  - Debug output saved to debug_output/
  - Results stored in storage/

## Current Focus
- Improving OCR accuracy and reliability
- Preventing false detections
- Better error handling
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

## Next Steps
See roadmap.md for detailed next steps and feature plans.
