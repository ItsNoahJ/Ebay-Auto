# OCR Challenges and Findings

## Current Challenges

The VHS cover text extraction presents several challenges:

1. **Image Quality Issues**
   - VHS covers often have complex backgrounds
   - Text may have varying contrast against backgrounds
   - Reflections and wear can affect text clarity

2. **Text Layout**
   - Multiple text regions with different styles
   - Varying font sizes and decorative fonts
   - Text may be at different angles or orientations

3. **Technical Limitations**
   - Basic OCR approaches (Tesseract) struggle with:
     - Low confidence scores on clear text
     - False positives on background patterns
     - Inconsistent region detection

## Attempted Solutions

1. **Image Preprocessing**
   - Scaling up images
   - Contrast enhancement (CLAHE)
   - Denoising
   - Adaptive thresholding
   - Morphological operations

2. **Tesseract Configuration**
   - Different PSM modes (3, 4, 6, 7, 11)
   - Character whitelisting
   - Region-specific configurations
   - Custom page segmentation

3. **Region-Based Processing**
   - Targeted region extraction
   - Region-specific preprocessing
   - Custom confidence thresholds

## Recommendations

1. **Short-term Improvements**
   - Implement multi-pass OCR with different settings
   - Add manual validation for low-confidence results
   - Consider template matching for common text patterns

2. **Long-term Solutions**
   - Develop a custom OCR model trained on VHS covers
   - Use deep learning for text detection and recognition
   - Build a database of common VHS cover layouts

3. **Alternative Approaches**
   - Consider integrating multiple OCR engines
   - Explore computer vision techniques beyond OCR
   - Research specialized algorithms for retro media scanning

## Next Steps

1. Research machine learning approaches specifically for VHS cover text detection
2. Collect and annotate a dataset of VHS covers for training
3. Investigate commercial OCR solutions with better handling of complex backgrounds
4. Consider implementing a hybrid approach combining multiple techniques
