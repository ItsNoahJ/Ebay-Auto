## Latest Benchmark Results (2025-03-11)

### Image Processing Pipeline
- **Preprocessing**: ~260ms average
  - Min: 210ms
  - Max: 363ms
  - Operations/sec: 3.85
- **Image Encoding**: ~3ms average
  - Min: 2.58ms
  - Max: 7.30ms
  - Operations/sec: 334.85

### Memory Usage
- Memory increase during processing remains under 1000MB
- Efficient memory management through:
  - Adaptive image resizing

  - GPU-optimized dimensions (32-pixel alignment)

### API Integration
- Optimized timeout: 15 seconds (reduced from 30s)
- Improved error handling with detailed diagnostics
- Streamlined prompts for faster inference
- Added response caching capability through cache_key

## Optimizations Applied

1. **Image Preprocessing**
   - Adaptive sizing based on input resolution
   - Minimum dimension enforcement (320px) for text readability
   - GPU-optimized dimension rounding (32-pixel multiples)
   - Enhanced CLAHE parameters for better contrast

2. **API Communication**
   - Reduced max_tokens to 20 for faster responses
   - Disabled streaming for speed
   - Added stop tokens for cleaner output
   - Improved error diagnostics

3. **Memory Management**
   - Target image size: 307,200 pixels (640x480 equivalent)
   - Target encoded size: 170KB
   - Adaptive JPEG quality (65-95%)
   - Efficient intermediate result handling

## Next Steps

1. **Further Optimization Opportunities**
   - Implement batch processing for multiple images
   - Add response caching with TTL
   - Explore async processing for parallel image handling
   - Consider WebP format for better compression ratios

2. **Monitoring Suggestions**
   - Add detailed timing breakdowns per processing stage
   - Track API response times across different models
   - Monitor memory usage patterns over time
   - Log quality metrics vs. processing speed trade-offs
